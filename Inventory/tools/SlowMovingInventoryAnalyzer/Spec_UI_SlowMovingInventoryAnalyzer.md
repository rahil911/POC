# Slow Moving Inventory Analyzer - UI/UX Specification

## 1. Tool Overview

The Slow Moving Inventory Analyzer is a specialized analytical tool that identifies, quantifies, and provides actionable insights on slow-moving and obsolete inventory. The system:

- Analyzes inventory turnover ratios and movement patterns to identify slow-moving items
- Calculates aging metrics and days of supply for inventory items
- Segments slow-moving inventory by categories, warehouses, and other dimensions
- Quantifies the financial impact of slow-moving inventory
- Visualizes inventory turnover and aging patterns through interactive dashboards
- Provides trend analysis of slow-moving inventory over time
- Generates prioritized recommendations for addressing slow-moving items
- Creates action plans for immediate, short-term, and long-term improvements
