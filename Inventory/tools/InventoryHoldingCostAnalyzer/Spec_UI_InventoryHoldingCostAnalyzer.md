# Inventory Holding Cost Analyzer - UI/UX Specification

## 1. Tool Overview

The Inventory Holding Cost Analyzer is a sophisticated analytical tool that identifies, quantifies, and optimizes inventory carrying costs across the organization. The system:

- Calculates comprehensive inventory holding costs across categories and warehouses
- Breaks down costs into component types (capital, storage, risk, opportunity)
- Identifies items and categories with excessive holding costs 
- Quantifies potential cost savings and optimization opportunities
- Visualizes cost structures and patterns through interactive dashboards
- Provides trend analysis of holding costs over time
- Benchmarks current costs against industry standards and historical targets
- Generates prioritized recommendations for reducing holding costs
- Creates action plans for immediate, short-term, and long-term cost reduction

## 2. Data Analysis & Patterns

### Primary Data Elements
- Inventory values by item, category, and warehouse
- Annual holding cost percentage and breakdown
- Opportunity cost metrics based on cost of capital
- Storage costs based on warehouse type and requirements
- Risk and obsolescence costs by item characteristics
- Excessive cost identification thresholds
