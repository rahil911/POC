# Stock Optimization Recommender - UI/UX Specification

## 1. Tool Overview

The Stock Optimization Recommender is an advanced inventory analytics engine that calculates optimal inventory parameters and provides actionable recommendations for stock level optimization. The system:

- Analyzes inventory patterns to identify optimal stock levels, reorder points, and order quantities
- Calculates safety stock requirements based on demand variability and service level targets
- Applies economic order quantity (EOQ) modeling to balance ordering and holding costs
- Identifies overstocked and understocked inventory items across warehouses
- Provides category-based and warehouse-based optimization insights
- Generates multi-horizon action plans with prioritized recommendations
- Visualizes current vs. optimal inventory parameters for decision support
- Calculates financial impact of optimization opportunities
