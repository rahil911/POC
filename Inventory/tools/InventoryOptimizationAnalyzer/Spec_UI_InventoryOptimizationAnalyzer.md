## 6. Integration with Other Tools

### Connected Data Flows
- **InventoryLevelAnalyzer**: Provides stock level data and stockout risk assessment
- **InventoryHoldingCostAnalyzer**: Supplies holding cost calculations and financial metrics
- **SlowMovingInventoryAnalyzer**: Identifies slow-moving and obsolete inventory items
- **StockOptimizationRecommender**: Provides optimal inventory parameters and recommendations
- **DemandForecastEngine**: Supplies demand forecasts for optimization modeling

### Integration Touchpoints
- **Inventory Management System**: Receive current inventory data and send optimization parameters
- **Procurement System**: Share order recommendations and parameter updates
- **Warehouse Management**: Provide location optimization recommendations
- **Financial Planning**: Send cost impact projections and savings forecasts
- **Project Management**: Export implementation plans and track progress

### Cross-Tool Navigation
- Unified inventory parameter definitions and calculations
- Consistent categorization and warehouse designations
- Shared optimization methodology and parameter settings
- Synchronized data views and time period selections
- Common visualization styles and interaction patterns
- Integrated action planning and implementation tracking

## 7. Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Processing Requirements
- Integrated data processing from multiple inventory analysis modules
- Multi-dimensional aggregation across categories and warehouses
- Complex financial impact modeling and opportunity prioritization
- Time-series trend analysis for performance metrics
- Statistical processing for health scoring and component analysis
- Implementation planning and resource allocation algorithms
- Results tracking and variance analysis calculations

### Accessibility Considerations
- Color blind friendly palette with pattern indicators for all visualizations
- Screen reader support for all metrics and recommendations
- Keyboard navigation for all dashboard elements
- Text alternatives for all visualizations
- High contrast mode for better visual distinction
- Scalable text without breaking dashboard layout

### Responsive Behavior
- **≥1440px**: Full dashboard with side-by-side visualizations
- **1024-1439px**: Two-column layout with stacked visualization panels
- **768-1023px**: Single column with compact visualizations
- **<768px**: Essential KPIs and summary recommendations with drill-down

### Performance Optimizations
- Progressive loading of visualization components
- On-demand calculation of complex optimization scenarios
- Lazy loading of secondary visualizations
- Pre-computed recommendations for common configurations
- Client-side caching of inventory parameter calculations
- Throttled updates during parameter adjustment
- Incremental data loading for large inventory datasets
