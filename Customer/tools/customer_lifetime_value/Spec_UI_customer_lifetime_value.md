- Analyzes purchase frequency and transaction value patterns
- Enables time-period analysis (monthly, quarterly, annual)
- Provides segment-specific LTV insights and comparisons
- Visualizes prediction accuracy and distribution patterns
- Supports strategic decision-making for customer investment

## 2. Data Analysis & Patterns
