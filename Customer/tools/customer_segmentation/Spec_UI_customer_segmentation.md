# Customer Segmentation Analyzer - UI/UX Specification

## 1. Tool Overview

The Customer Segmentation Analyzer is a sophisticated customer analytics tool that applies clustering techniques to identify meaningful customer segments based on various behavioral, transactional, and demographic dimensions. The system:

- Segments customers using multiple methodologies (RFM, behavioral, demographic, value-based)
- Applies machine learning clustering algorithms to identify natural groupings
- Automatically determines optimal segment counts through statistical analysis
- Visualizes segment distributions and characteristics
- Analyzes key metrics and attributes for each segment
- Identifies distinct behavior patterns and value propositions per segment
- Enables targeted marketing strategy development

## 2. Data Analysis & Patterns

### Primary Data Elements
- Customer transaction history (frequency, recency, monetary value)
- Customer demographics (type, region, industry)
- Purchase behavior metrics (average order value, total spend)
- Engagement metrics (interaction count, loyalty score)
- Financial attributes (credit limit, outstanding balance)
- Temporal patterns (purchase recency, account status)
- Derived segment classifications

### Key Analysis Methods
- K-Means clustering for segment identification
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Optimal cluster determination using elbow method
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Segment characteristic profiling
- Distribution analysis across segments
- Comparative segment metrics evaluation

## 3. Current vs. Target Visualization State

### Current State
The tool currently provides rudimentary visualization with:
- Static matplotlib scatter plots saved as PNG images
- Basic 2D visualization using PCA components
- Simple coloring of clusters without detailed segment profiling
- No interactive capabilities or filtering
- Limited segment characteristic analysis in text format
- Single visualization method regardless of segment complexity
- No ability to explore segment members or adjust parameters

### Target State
Transform into a comprehensive customer segmentation dashboard with:
- Interactive multi-dimensional segment explorer with filtering controls
- Rich segment profile cards with detailed behavioral insights
- Segment evolution tracking over multiple time periods
- Interactive parameter adjustment for segmentation methods
- Customizable visualization approaches based on segment dimensions
- Actionable marketing recommendations tailored to each segment
- Integrated segment-based customer journey mapping
