# Performance Deviation Analyzer - UI/UX Specification

## 1. Tool Overview

The Performance Deviation Analyzer is a sophisticated business intelligence tool that applies machine learning to detect, analyze, and visualize significant deviations in business performance. The system:

- Extracts KPI data across multiple business functions (sales, customer, finance)
- Correlates performance with external factors and market conditions
- Uses gradient boosting regression to model expected performance
- Identifies statistically significant deviations from predictions
- Calculates feature importance to explain performance variations
- Decomposes variance to quantify explained vs. unexplained factors
- Provides actionable insights based on deviation patterns

## 2. Data Analysis & Patterns
